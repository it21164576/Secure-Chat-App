## General Information
- With continuously increasing technology, as well as new chating applications emerging every now and then, we wanted to learn about security aspects of these applications and also about the cryptographic encryption and decryption processes
- This app has different rooms for different subjects and users can log into these rooms with passwords and chat with each other securely and in realtime
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
